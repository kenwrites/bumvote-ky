# How'd The Bum Vote?

## Problems to solve

1. Get files.  Tools:  BASH script with CURL.  Automate with `cron`.
2. Extract vote data.  Tools:  `pdftohtml`, part of poppler-utils.  See what else is in poppler-utils, as well.
3.  Organize vote data & associate with legislators.
4.  Output vote history per legislator on request.
5.  Send new vote history reports at intervals.
6.  Accept & manage site users.
